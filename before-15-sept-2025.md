Before the classes started at 15 of september 2025, I began the project by:

1 - Writing a survey, that can be answered in the following link:

In this survey, directed to people who plays basketball either on a team or just casual games in public/private courts.
With this survey I can understand how basketball players uses the public court, the frequency and the problems they have, in order to figure out the main features and priorities.

I also design a flyer to share the survey and intend to distribute in several public courts:

- [flyer en](https://github.com/Pedro3Azevedo/the-playground/tree/main/research/initial-research/3.png)

2 - Read the first chapter of _Simplifying Application Development with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile_ by Robert Nagy, published by Pact Publishing in March 2022.
In this chapter he compares the different approaches to develop mobile applications, and some technologies.
I wrote a document talking about the differences, the pros and the cons of developing Native apps, Cross-platform and Multiplatform.

The book is considered outdated, so I bought a new to start reading and following some tutorials:

- _Kotlin in Depth Coroutines, Compose, Multiplatform Apps for Android and Beyond_, Thomas Carter, Lincoln Publishers, 30 July 2025

3 - Read the following articles:

- [Mobile App Development Plan: Concept, Audiences, Design, Wireframing](https://www.appventurez.com/blog/mobile-app-development-planning)
- [Complete Guide to Successful App Development for Startups](https://www.appventurez.com/blog/mobile-app-development-for-startups)
